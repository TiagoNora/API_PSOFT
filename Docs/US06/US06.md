> ACME users can review an item providing a text with the review and a rating (0 to 5 stars, including half stars). Reviews need to be approved by a moderator before being published.

 **From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** 
> Should review votes be presented in a single value that increases and decreases or should there be two values that would be "upVotes" and "downVotes"?
